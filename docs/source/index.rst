Plonk is a Python tool for analysis and visualization of smoothed particle
hydrodynamics data with a focus on astrophysical fluid dynamics.

With Plonk we aim to integrate the high quality SPH visualisation of
Splash into the modern Python astronomer workflow, and provide a framework for
analysis of smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulation data.

.. warning::
    Plonk is under development. However, it is becoming more stable. Please use
    Plonk and if you have any issues or feature requests please leave feedback
    by raising a `GitHub issue
    <https://github.com/dmentipl/plonk/issues/new/choose>`_.

Other Packages
--------------

Here are some other, mature, Python analysis and visualization packages for
smoothed particle hydrodynamics, and other scientific, data:

* `pynbody <http://pynbody.github.io/pynbody/>`_ --- "an analysis package for
  astrophysical N-body and Smooth Particle Hydrodynamics simulations".
* `Py-SPHViewer <http://alejandrobll.github.io/py-sphviewer/>`_ --- "a parallel
  Python package to visualise and explore N-body + Hydrodynamics simulations
  using the Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) scheme".
* `yt <https://yt-project.org/>`_ project --- "yt is an open-source,
  permissively-licensed Python package for analyzing and visualizing volumetric
  data".

In addition, `Splash <https://github.com/danieljprice/splash>`_ is a mature,
Unix command line, "free and open source visualisation tool for Smoothed
Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations", written in Fortran.
