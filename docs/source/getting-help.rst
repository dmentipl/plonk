Getting help
============

If you need help, try the following, in order:

1. Check the documentation.
2. Check the built-in help, e.g. `help(plonk.load_snap)`.
3. File an issue, as a
   `bug report <https://github.com/dmentipl/plonk/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=bug_report.md&title=>`_
   or `feature request <https://github.com/dmentipl/plonk/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=feature_request.md&title=>`_,
   using the issue tracker on GitHub.

If you don't get an immediate response, please be patient. Plonk is maintained
by one person, `@dmentipl <https://github.com/dmentipl>`_.
