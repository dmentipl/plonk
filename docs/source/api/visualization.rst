Smoothed particle hydrodynamics data as a :class:`Snap` can be visualized by
plotting the particles directly with or without color or size variation to
represent a quantity, or via interpolation of scalar and vector quantities to a
pixel grid, presented as an image, contour plot, vector plot, or stream plot.

Below are the functions for visualization, and interpolation, of particle data
to a pixel grid, particle plots, and functions to produce animations of these
visualizations and of :class:`Profile` objects.
