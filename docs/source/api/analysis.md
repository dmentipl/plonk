Smoothed particle hydrodynamics analysis tools include taking radial (or linear)
profiles, filtering particles, calculating derived quantities on particles,
calculating global quantities, functions for sinks and discs, and functions for
SPH summation and derivatives.

The {class}`Profile` class provides methods for generating 1-dimensional
profiles from the 3-dimensional particle data.
