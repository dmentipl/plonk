SPH snapshot files are represented by the :py:class:`Snap` class. This object
contains a properties dictionary, particle arrays, which are lazily loaded from
file, sink arrays, and additional metadata. There are methods for accessing
arrays, sub-sets of particles, plotting, finding particle neighbours, etc.

:py:class:`Simulation` is an aggregation of the :py:class:`Snap` and pandas
DataFrames to encapsulate all data within a single SPH simulation. In addition,
you can load auxilliary SPH simulation data, such as globally-averaged time
series data as pandas DataFrames.
