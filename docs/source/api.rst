.. currentmodule:: plonk

Here is the documentation for the Plonk API. It provides documentation of the
available functions and classes in Plonk.

The documentation is generated from the function/class docstrings, and so is
also available at the Python/IPython REPL or in a Jupyter notebook, e.g.
:code:`help(plonk.load_snap)` and :code:`plonk.load_snap?`.
