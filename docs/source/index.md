## About

Plonk is a Python tool for analysis and visualization of smoothed particle
hydrodynamics data with a focus on astrophysical fluid dynamics.

With Plonk we aim to integrate the high quality SPH visualisation of
[Splash](https://github.com/danieljprice/splash) into the modern Python
astronomer workflow, and to provide a framework for analysis of smoothed
particle hydrodynamics simulation data.

```{note}
Plonk is being used for [scientific publications](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019JOSS....4.1884M/citations).
However, no software is bug free. Please use Plonk and if you have any
issues or feature requests please leave feedback by raising a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/dmentipl/plonk/issues/new/choose).

## Other Packages

Here are some other, mature, Python analysis and visualization packages for
smoothed particle hydrodynamics, and other scientific, data:

- [pynbody](http://pynbody.github.io/pynbody/) --- "an analysis package for
  astrophysical N-body and Smooth Particle Hydrodynamics simulations".
- [Py-SPHViewer](http://alejandrobll.github.io/py-sphviewer/) --- "a parallel
  Python package to visualise and explore N-body + Hydrodynamics simulations
  using the Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) scheme".
- [yt](https://yt-project.org/) project --- "yt is an open-source,
  permissively-licensed Python package for analyzing and visualizing volumetric
  data".

In addition, [Splash](https://github.com/danieljprice/splash) is a mature,
Unix command line, "free and open source visualisation tool for Smoothed
Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations", written in Fortran.
